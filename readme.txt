== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this different from other accessibility plugins? =

RayWP Accessibility Pro actually works by processing your entire page output, not just post content. This means ARIA attributes are properly applied to navigation, headers, footers, and all page elements. The plugin also includes comprehensive form scanning and validation features.

= Does this plugin fix all accessibility issues? =

No plugin can fix all accessibility issues automatically. RayWP Accessibility Pro provides tools to fix common issues and helps you implement proper ARIA markup, but manual testing and review are still necessary for full compliance.

= Can I test my CSS selectors before applying them? =

Yes! The plugin includes a real-time selector testing feature that shows you exactly which elements will be affected by your rules.
